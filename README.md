# Indian-Govt-Budget-allocation-to-education-sector


# The Goal:

The years from2020-21 to 2022-23 are taken into consideration to understand how resources are allotted to different sectors ,states ,uts,etc.
It has been attempted to drive meaningful insights so that the areas in need of resources are given more and strengthened.

# Solution:

With the help of SQL I have tried to put light on the areas that can be strengthened if the expertise of the private sector in general and edtech companies in particular is taken under consideration.
